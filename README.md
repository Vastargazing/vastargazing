# 🤖 AI Engineer | ML Pipeline Developer

### 👋 Hi! I'm learning AI Engineering through hands-on projects

**Creative background meets AI:** 10+ years living a creative life — photography, painting, video — with the past 6 years focused on music production, and the last year diving into rap music (beats and lyrics).

## 🎯 Featured Project: [Rap Lyrics Cultural Analyzer]([your-repo-link](https://github.com/Vastargazing/rap-scraper-project))

> Production-ready ML pipeline analyzing hip-hop culture trends through AI

### 📊 **Impact Metrics:**
```
📈 52K+ tracks scraped       🎵 314 artists analyzed
🤖 14K+ AI analyses         📊 200MB+ production dataset
⚡ FREE analysis pipeline   🎯 Multi-model AI integration

```

### 🛠️ **Technical Architecture:**
- **Data Pipeline:** Python 3.13 + Pydantic, async processing, rate limiting
- **AI Integration:** Ollama (local) + Groq (cloud), hybrid deployment strategy
- **Models:** Groq API for explicit content analysis, Gemma 27B remote for general tasks
- **APIs:** Genius, Spotify Web API with structured metadata
- **Storage:** SQLite production database, structured JSON exports  
- **Interface:** CLI tool + system monitoring + error handling

### 🔥 **Current Challenges:**
- Smart model routing: Groq for explicit lyrics, Gemma for general analysis
- Overcoming content filtering limitations in cultural AI analysis
- A/B testing model performance across different lyrical content types
- Scaling FREE pipeline to 100K+ tracks with intelligent model selection
