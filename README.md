# 🤖 AI Engineer in Training | Cultural ML Builder

### 👋 Hi! I'm learning AI Engineering through hands-on projects

**Creative background meets AI:** 10+ years living a creative life — photography, painting, video — with the past 6 years focused on music production, and the last year diving into rap music (beats and lyrics).

## 🎯 Featured Project: [Rap Lyrics Cultural Analyzer]([your-repo-link](https://github.com/Vastargazing/rap-scraper-project))

> A prototype ML pipeline for decoding hip-hop culture trends with AI, built from scratch.

### 📊 **Impact Metrics:**
```
📈 52K+ tracks scraped       🎵 314 artists analyzed
🤖 14K+ AI analyses         📊 200MB+ production dataset
⚡ FREE analysis pipeline   🎯 Multi-model AI integration

```

 ### 🛠️ **Technical Architecture:**
- **Data Pipeline:** Python 3.13 + Pydantic validation, async processing, intelligent rate limiting
- **AI Integration:** Multi-provider architecture - Gemma 3 27B (production), Ollama (local dev), LangChain framework
- **ML Models:** Google Gemma 27B via Google AI Studio API (89% sentiment accuracy), planning Groq + GPT-4o migration
- **APIs:** Genius lyrics + Spotify Web API with OAuth 2.0, structured metadata enrichment
- **Storage:** Production SQLite database (200MB+), Pydantic-validated JSON exports, automated schema management
- **Interface:** Full CLI tool + system monitoring + error handling + progress tracking
- **DevOps:** Structured logging, API quota management, graceful degradation, batch processing optimization

### 🔥 **Current Challenges:**
- Smart model routing: Groq for explicit lyrics, Gemma for general analysis
- Overcoming content filtering limitations in cultural AI analysis
- A/B testing model performance across different lyrical content types
- Scaling FREE pipeline to 100K+ tracks with intelligent model selection
